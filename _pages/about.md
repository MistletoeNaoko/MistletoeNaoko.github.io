I am working in Mitsubishi Electric Corporation as a researcher. From July 2024 to July 2025, I worked as a visiting researcher at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL)](https://www.merl.com/). I got a PhD of the Information and Computer Science in [Fujishiro Laboratory](https://fj.ics.keio.ac.jp) at Keio University in 2021. Since September 2018, I was a visiting scholar of the [Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University from 2018 to 2020. 

My research interests (2025) are in visualizations for time-series data, novel view synthesis, and AR.
