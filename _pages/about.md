I am working in Mitsubishi Electric Corp. as a researcher. I got a PhD in the Information and Computert Science in [Fujishiro Laboratory](https://fj.ics.keio.ac.jp) at Keio University in 2021. Since September 2018, I was a visiting scholar of the [Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University from 2018 to 2020. 

My research interests (2024) are in visualizations for time-series data, novel view synthesis, and AR.
